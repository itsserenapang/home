						<p> As a member of 8 Globemaster Squadron for 5 years, I learnt much of my present day dedication and motivation from the program. The youth-led program trains members to start as team members, and slowly train and work their way up to a leadership position in the program.
						<br> In my final year with the RCAC, I was a flight commander to over 30 cadets, ages ranging from 12 to 17. As a flight commander, I had to constantly make sure my cadets were cared for, safe, and were being taught the proper professionalism and teamwork a cadet is required to have.

							<p> As a senior, I often worked with peers I had grown up with in the program. Together, we would plan squadron-wide events (150+ cadets total) to entertain and teach valuable lessons. With this process, organization, time-management, and responsibility were vital to success in the program.
							<br> Some examples of events I've organized for the squadron include various team-building days, multiple banquets and award presentations, and field training exercises.

							<p> In my last year, I built a strong bond with my flight, Falcon Flight. I started my cadet career at 12, as the lowest ranking. When I became a flight commander to the very flight that raised me, it felt as though I had come full circle.
							<br> Though I was the mentor to juniors that would eventually replace me, I truly treated and believed them to be my second family. There is nothing I wouldn't do to see their happiness and success fluorish. 
							<br> The cadet program taught me a new way of thinking, and brought me the confidence and a community that inspires me to this day.
